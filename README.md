To clone and set-up the project locally git clone it and then run the following commands:

1) yarn

2) yarn start

3) Go to localhost to see the project displayed live.

Dependencies:

react-router-dom
node-sass
styled-components

The project has been set-up with "react-router-dom" so routes can easily be implemented further down the line when they become necessary.
Also added SASS to enable scss and styled components for future potential usage.
